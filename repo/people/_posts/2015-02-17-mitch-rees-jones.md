## About
I am a student at N.C. State University, majoring in Computer Science and at least minoring in 
math. I started working as a curator and programmer on OpenScience in January 2015, and since 
then, I've added a number of datasets to the repo and done a lot of website structural work.

My interests are far and wide, but I do find AI to be very interesting. I'm in the middle of 
starting some AI projects, which I may write about on my website at [www.reesjones.co](http://www.reesjones.co).
Over the summer, I will be interning with the IBM Watson Group, which I am very excited about.

If you have any questions about OpenScience or the repository, feel free to email me at
