# How to add Data to this Repo

## Step1: become a colloborator of this repo

+ Email any member of the [current writers](https://github.com/opensciences/opensciences.github.io/graphs/contributors)
  asking for access.
  
## Step2: Open two windows in a browser:

+ The [forms entry screen](http://openscience.us/repo/contribute/donate) for the repo
+ The [issues list](https://github.com/opensciences/opensciences.github.io/issues) for the repo

Note that your mission is to take the papers maked in **yellow** in the 
issues list and enter their details into the **forms entry sceen**.

A little background is needed to explain the colors in the issue list. These color are assigned by the PROMISE custodians as they work on who gets to read what appers. First, they find a conference. Then, they bust up the table of contents into chunks (of, say, 20 papers each) after which someone has a quick peel to see if any have data. If they do, then they get marked in yellow in the issue list.

## Step3: Repeat till Bored

1. Find any unassigned yellow issue (the "maybe has data" label) and assign it to yourself.
2. Read the paper (not in detail; skimming may suffice);
3. If some dataset is available:
      + Fill in a   [form](http://openscience.us/repo/contribute/donate) for this paper (see instructions, below).
      + Change the label of this paper to "summarized".
4. If the paper mentions data but there is no link found in the paper:
      + Email the author asking for a link to the data
      + Change the label if issueto "Need email with authors". In clude the text of your sent email in the comment for that issue.
5. If there is no data, change label of issue to "no data"
6. Also, if the paper mentions some web-accessible tool, add a label "Tool"
7. Goto 1

## Step 3.3a: Filling in a Form

You will need a concise (short) one word name for the data (use "-" to seperate words if you need to).


For _Catagories_, see the list LHS of openscience.us/repo. FYI, the current categories are shown on right.

+ If you can't see a suitable category, [email us](mailto:openscience.content@gmail.com) with the paper link and we will add one.

Note that a _general overview_ of the data is mandatory:

+ You can probably build that from the abstract.

Note that, also, we need some (perhpas very brief) notes about the attributes.
