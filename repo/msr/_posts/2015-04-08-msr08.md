# About the Data

## Overview of Data

Eclipse: 5 files, ~7GB, possibly update from 2007 MSR

The first four of these files are CVS repository dumps form Eclipse-JDT, Eclipse-SWT, Eclipse-Platform, and Eclipse-Rest. In order to mine these, you will need to have a means of handling CVS repositories. These files are listed as:

 * eclipse-cvs-jdt.tgz
 * eclipse-cvs-swt.tgz
 * eclipse-cvs-plarform.tgz
 * eclipse-cvs-rest.tgz

The fifth data file XML bug reports dumped from the Eclipse Bugzilla page. It is listed as:

 * eclipse-bugs-000001-213000.zip
