# Notes from the Author

This is a PROMISE Software Engineering Repository data set made publicly
available in order to encourage repeatable, verifiable, refutable, and/or
improvable predictive models of software engineering.

  (b) Donor of database: owner

  (c) Date received: 31 March 2005

3. Past Usage: none

4. Relevant Information:

This dataset was assembled by analyzing the publicly-available CVS archives of the Nickle programming language ([http://nickle.org](http://nickle.org)) using a modified version of CVSAnalY ([http://metricsgrimoire.github.io/CVSAnalY](http://metricsgrimoire.github.io/CVSAnalY)). It is intended for a wide variety of uses, and thus no dependent variable is specified.  See Massey's PROMISE 2005 paper, "Longitudinal Analysis of Long-Timescale Open Source Repository Data", for further information.
