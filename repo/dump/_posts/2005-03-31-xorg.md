#Notes from the Author

This is a PROMISE Software Engineering Repository data set made publicly
available in order to encourage repeatable, verifiable, refutable, and/or
improvable predictive models of software engineering.


1. Title: X.org Repository Transaction Data

  (b) Donor of database: owner

  (c) Date received: 31 March 2005

3. Past Usage: none

4. Relevant Information:

This dataset was assembled by analyzing the publicly-available CVS archives of X.org [http://x.org)](http://x.org) available on freedesktop.org [http://freedesktop.org)](http://freedesktop.org) using a modified version of CVSAnalY ([http://metricsgrimoire.github.io/CVSAnalY](http://metricsgrimoire.github.io/CVSAnalY).) It is intended for a wide variety of uses, and thus no dependent variable is specified.  See Massey's PROMISE 2005 paper, "Longitudinal Analysis of Long-Timescale Open Source Repository Data", for further information. Note that on 668 occasions, a negative lines-added count was recorded by CVSAnalY, apparently due to a bug.  These entries should probably be repaired or at least filtered out.

5. Number of Instances: 136435

6. Number of Attributes: 10 (incl. 2 inferred)

7. Attribute information:

   * Inferred filetype:
     * non-numeric---nominal
     * 9 values (documentation,images,i18n,ui,multimedia,code,build,devel-doc,unknown)
   * File Pathname: UNIX relative path name
     * non-numeric---structured
     * 1567 directories, 20382 files
   * Revision: dotted-decimal revision string
     * non-numeric---structured
     * 1740 unique revision numbers
   * Author ID: integer identifier
     * non-numeric---nominal
     * 42 unique authors
   * Lines added: integer
     * numeric---integer
     * MIN: 0  MAX: 132642  MEAN: 81.9752  STDEV: 1221.55
     * MIN: 0  MAX: 26150  MEAN: 38.7436  STDEV: 354.985
     * (excl. images, multimedia)
     * Note: on 668 occasions, a negative lines-added count was recorded by CVSAnalY, apparently due to a bug. In the summary statistics reported in this comment, these additions are not counted.
   * Lines removed: integer
     * numeric---integer
     * MIN: 0  MAX: 11765  MEAN: 16.0445  STDEV: 143.589
     * MIN: 0  MAX: 11765  MEAN: 13.9409  STDEV: 128.19
     * (excl. images, multimedia)
   * File has since been removed ("in Attic"): boolean (0, 1)
     * non-numeric---nominal
     * 21.19% positive
   * Commit has CVS_SILENT flag: boolean (0, 1)
     * non-numeric---nominal
     * never set
   * Inferred that committer was not author: boolean (0, 1)
     * non-numeric---nominal
     * 0.46% positive
   * Commit date:  date
     * MIN: "2003-11-14 15:54:29"  MAX: "2005-02-19 16:00:13"
     * Note: CVS has trouble with timezones; we assume all dates are UTC.

8. Missing Attribute Values:

  * unknown inferred filetype (attr 1): 17280

9. Class Distribution:  N/A
