# Change Log

When | What
---- | ----
March  2010 | JPL experts added expected number of defects and months to create coc81-dem
Dec 2009 | Correction: the original PROMISE repository data set had incorrect DATA and CPLX effort multiplier  values for project 32 and did not include prjoject\_id, dev\_mode, and the first row of headers as it does now
February 8, 2006 | Donated by [Tim Menzies](/repo/people/data-donors/promise3.html)
