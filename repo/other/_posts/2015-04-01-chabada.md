#About the Data

##Overview of Data

How do we know a program does what it claims to do? After clustering Android apps by their
description topics, we identify outliers in each cluster with respect to their API usage. A
"weather" app that sends messages thus becomes an anomaly; likewise, a "messaging" app would
typically not be expected to access the current location. Applied on a set of 22,500+ Android
applications, our CHABADA prototype identified several anomalies; additionally, it flagged 56%
of novel malware as such, without requiring any known malware patterns.
