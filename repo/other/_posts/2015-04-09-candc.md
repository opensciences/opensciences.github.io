# About the Data

## Overview of Data

We conducted a small user study to examine two high level
research questions: [RC1] is C&C verification difficult
to do manually, and [RC2] are witnesses for satisfaction/non-satisfaction
helpful. The study included a two-pages introduction
on C&C views to read, 3 verification questions (each
presenting one C&C view), and 3 questions about the usefulness
of a set of witnesses that was presented to the user,
all referring to a common C&C model. Two of the views
in the first 3 questions had 2 non-satisfaction reasons each.
The questions of each group were presented to the users in
a random order to avoid a bias due to learning effect.
The study subjects were all CS graduate students or professional
software engineers, all with some modeling background
but no specific previous knowledge on our work on
C&C views. No grades or other reward was involved. The
study was anonymous and conducted online. We obtained
complete set of answers from 17 subjects.

| Component and connector (C&C) models are used in many application domains of software engineering. C&C views can be used to specify structural properties of C&C models, e.g., which component should be inside which component, which component should be connected to which component, in an expressive and intuitive way. An introduction to C&C models and C&C views is given in this PDF. All the tasks in the exercise are based on the same C&C model of a pump station (download the PDF here).

## Paper Abstract

The structure of component and connector (C&C) models,
which are used in many application domains of software engineering,
consists of components at different containment
levels, their typed input and output ports, and the connectors
between them. C&C views, presented in [24], can be
used to specify structural properties of C&C models in an
expressive and intuitive way.
In this work we address the verification of a C&C model
against a C&C view and present efficient (polynomial) algorithms
to decide satisfaction. A unique feature of our
work, not present in existing approaches to checking structural
properties of C&C models, is the generation of witnesses
for satisfaction/non-satisfaction and of short naturallanguage
texts, which serve to explain and formally justify
the verification results and point the engineer to its causes.
A prototype tool and an evaluation over four example
systems with multiple views, performance and scalability
experiments, as well as a user study of the usefulness of
the witnesses for engineers, demonstrate the contribution of
our work to the state-of-the-art in component and connector
modeling and analysis.
