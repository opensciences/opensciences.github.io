# About the Data

## Overview of Data

The evaluation material presented here is for WASP application, which is used for one of the case studies in this paper. WASP stands for Web Architectures for Services Platforms. More information about the project and the case study (change scenarios) can be found in this [Masters' Thesis](https://www.utwente.nl/ewi/trese/graduation_projects/2009/VanDomburg.pdf).

## Paper Abstract

We present NARCIA, a tool for analyzing the impact of change in natural language requirements. For a given change in a requirements document, NARCIA calculates quantitative scores suggesting how likely each requirements statement in the document is to be impacted. These scores, computed using Natural Language Processing (NLP), are used for sorting the requirements statements, enabling the user to focus on statements that are most likely to be impacted. To increase the accuracy of change impact analysis, NARCIA provides a mechanism for making explicit the rationale behind changes. NARCIA has been empirically evaluated on two industrial case studies. The results of this evaluation are briefly highlighted.
