# Title/Topic: JM1/software defect prediction

      * Pat Callis, NASA, NASA project manager for MDP (Patrick.E.Callis@ivv.nasa.gov) +1-304-367-8309 
  * Past usage:
    * How Good is Your Blind  Spot Sampling Policy?; 2003; Tim Menzies and Justin S. Di Stefano; 2004 IEEE Conference on High Assurance Software Engineering ([http://menzies.us/pdf/03blind.pdf](http://menzies.us/pdf/03blind.pdf)).
      * Results: 
        * Very simple learners (ROCKY) perform as well in this domain as more sophisticated methods (e.g. J48, model trees, model trees) for predicting detects
        * Many learners have very low false alarm rates.
        * Probability of detection (PD) rises with effort and rarely rises above it.
        * High PDs are associated with high PFs (probability of failure)
         * PD, PF, effort can change significantly while accuracy remains essentially stable
        * With two notable exceptions, detectors learned from one data set (e.g. KC2) have nearly they same properties when applied to another (e.g. PC2, KC2). Exceptions:
          * LinesOfCode measures generate wider inter-data-set variances; 
          * Precision's inter-data-set variances vary wildly

      * Results:
        * From JM1, Naive Bayes generated PDs of 25% with PF of 20%
        * Naive Bayes out-performs J48 for defect detection
        * When learning on more and more data, little improvement is seen after processing 300 examples.
        * PDs are much higher from data collected below the sub-sub-system level.          
        * Accuracy is a surprisingly uninformative measure of success for a defect detector. Two detectors with the same accuracy can have widely varying PDs and PFs.
  * Relevant information:
    * JM1 is written in "C" and is a real-time predictive ground system: Uses simulations to generate predictions
    * Data comes from McCabe and Halstead features extractors of source code.  These features were defined in the 70s in an attempt to objectively characterize code features that are associated with software quality.  The nature of association is under dispute. Notes on McCabe can be found [here](/repo/defect/mccabehalsted/tut.html) and notes on Halstead can be found [here](/repo/defect/mccabehalsted/tut.html). These metrics are widely used for defect prediction purposes, a quick tutorial on defect prediction is given [here](/repo/defect/tut.html).

#Comments on the Data

Martin Shepperd | August 19th, 2011 at 10:52 am
I’ve realised this version of the dataset *differs* from the version available from the NASA MDP website. The following tabulates the differences for all 13 NASA datasets:
\{\{\{

Dataset	        n cases	p features
CM1 – NASA	505	40

CM1 – Promise	498	21

JM1 – NASA	10878	21

JM1 – Promise	10885	21

KC1 – NASA	2107	21

KC1 – Promise	2109	21

KC3 – NASA	458	40

KC3 – Promise	458	39

MC1 – NASA	9466	39

MC1 – Promise	9466	38

MC2 – NASA	161	40

MC2 – Promise	161	39

MW1 – NASA	403	40

MW1 – Promise	403	37

PC1 – NASA	1107	40

PC1 – Promise	1109	21

PC2 – NASA	5589	40

PC2 – Promise	5589	36

PC3 – NASA	1563	40

PC3 – Promise	1563	37

PC4 – NASA	1458	40

PC4 – Promise	1458	37

PC5- NASA	17186	39

PC5 – Promise	17186	38

KC4- NASA	125	40

KC2 – Promise	522	22
\}\}\}

Therefore researchers are *strongly* advised to indicate which version of these files they are using!

Martin Shepperd | August 19th, 2011 at 10:54 am: It is also puzzling how features such as loc can contain values like 1.1 (see feature 1, case 1).

Martin Shepperd | August 20th, 2011 at 7:03 am: Sorry small error — the two versions of this dataset have the following sizes:

\{\{\{

Version,         Cases(n),   Features(p)
JM1 – NASA,      10878,      24
JM1 – Promise,   10885,      22

\}\}\}
