# Notes from the Author

For more details on this data set, see [Shepperd | August 20th, 2011 at 7:12 am

Be aware that the Promise version of this dataset differs from the NASA MDP version:

Version,Cases(n),Features(p)
MW1 – NASA,403,43
MW1 – Promise,403,38

Therefore researchers are *strongly* advised to indicate which version of these files they are using!
