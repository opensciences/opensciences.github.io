# Notes

Data from a Turkish white-goods manufacturer <br>
Embedded software implemented in C.

Function/method level static code attributes are collected using the Prest Metrics Extraction and Analysis Tool.

In this data,
ar*.arff files keep defect information in a discrete manner (whether there is bug or not), whereas ar*_numericdefects.arff files keep the bug count associated with the defectives.
