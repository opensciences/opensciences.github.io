We are always looking for new data to add to the PROMISE repository. The OpenScience project depends on the [many people](/repo/people) that put their time and effort into maintaining and expanding this repository, and for good reason. The results of software engineering research must be reproducible and repeatable, and in order to make it so, the data used in academic research must be made available. People like you can make that happen by contributing to the repository! If you are a researcher who would like to donate data or if you would like to help expand the repository by attending a hackathon, read on.

There are two ways to contribute to the OpenSciences project.

# 1. If you have software engineering-related data sets:

If you own or have access to data that you (and the author(s), if you are not an author) would like to be easily
accessible through the Open Science repository, please fill out 
[this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1swz9OvupVVMtEOeG2j3DdM3SqIhE0Nw495lzr3dMUAE/) with the
appropriate information. You can also email the curators at [openscience.content@gmail.com](mailto:openscience.content@gmail.com). When we host data sets, we will include
context notes about the data and the associated research. If possible, you should include in your email [context
notes](/repo/contribute/contextnotes.html) that we will use on the actual webpage for your data.

# 2. If you want to participate in our hackathons:

We will be periodically hosting hackathons to track down and add SE data and papers en masse. If you are interested in joining one, either remotely with Google Hangouts or in person in Engineering Building II at North Carolina State University, fill out [this Google interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18s9ZLb7TTLcXVRovqRcn5YEN6Js9aJZgPfn_2qz3WFE/viewform?usp=send_form) and look at the instructions on [how to help during the hackathon](/repo/contribute/hackathon.html). {% if page.title %} {{site.hackathonInfo}}{% endif %}
