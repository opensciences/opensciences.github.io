On this page, we discuss the problems that motivated
this site.

Before reading these solutions, it can be useful to
first read and understand our definition of
[research types](cfp.html).

## Problem #1: Publications are too Dependent on Fee-for-Service Organizations

According to the Whitehouse Office of Science and Technology,
[citizens deserve easy access to the results of scientific research their tax dollars have paid for"](http://goo.gl/wlMKP). Yet
many scientific results are locked away behind
firewalls.  The fee-for-service publishing houses
boast exorbitantly large profit margins for the
publications of our papers: mean figures from
Elsevier, Springer, and John Wiley Sons over the
last decade range from 33 to 42 
[115, 130]).  ACM and IEEE,
while not for profit, are likewise fee-for-service.
These costs are increasing.  For example, at Harvard
University, prices for content from two providers
have increased by about 145 over the past six years,
which exceeds not only the consumer price index, but
also the higher education and the library price
indices [26].



### SOLUTION #1

Replace all the pay-for-publication infrastructure
with a free-to-use infrastructure. As shown in this
proposal, SE researchers already have access to all
the building blocks needed for this
infrastructure. All that is required is a little
assembly work, plus access to reasonable-sized cloud
storage facility such as the petabyte repository
proposed here.  Due to their experience and
prominence in the field

## PROBLEM : Lack of Control of Publication Policies

Here is a small example of very widespread problem:
In 2010, the PIs were part of a team of half a dozen
prominent SE researchers that tried to convince
three leading SE journals to change their _short
paper_ policy.  The proposed change was that "papers
under 4 pages will be reviewed in one month".  This
proposed change was motivated by a desire to:

1. increase the currency of recent publications;
2. engage more with our industrial colleagues who 
   find it easy to contribute to such a shorter format.  

The proposal was discussed, at
length, with the editors of the ASE journal, IEEE
TSE, and EMSE.  Those editors expressed interest in
the idea but commented they were unable to effect
that kind of editorial change without clearing it
with the publisher.  In the end, this proposal was
never implemented, despite the interest expressed by
those editors and despite the ardent advocacy of
prominent and active SE researchers. 

This is a troubling story. As SE researchers, we
volunteer our labor to write, review, and edit the
papers. We staff the editorial boards. We even train
the next generation of researchers to write the next
generation of papers. Nevertheless, even though we
generate and moderate the content of our
publications, we cannot change even small details on
how that content is collected and
disseminated. Clearly, it is time for a change.

_SOLUTION:_ Take back control of how our research
content is disseminated.  

+ Step away from the
infrastructure offered by the fee-for-service
publishing companies.  
+ Create a free  infrastructure
for the dissemination of research results (this web site and this journal).
+ Run a bi-annual town hall meetings
with researchers in order to give a broad community
control of the policies of that infrastructure.

##  PROBLEM: Too Little Interaction Between Industry and Academia 

The PIs of this proposal have frequent contact with
a very large industrial community engaged in
software innovation.  These developers at Raleigh,
Seattle, and Silicon Valley are responsible for
innovations that have changed how software is
developed and how we interact with that software
(e.g. the iPhone interface from Apple; agile and
open-source development practices and tools such as
GitHub; exabyte-level cloud storage; industrial
mega-scale data mining at Google, Yahoo, and
Microsoft; etc). A common complaint we hear from
those innovative developers is that academic
software engineering papers published in conferences
and journals are irrelevant and removed from their
needs, interests, and results.

_SOLUTION:_ Remove the barriers that block our
industrial partners from participating in academic
forums.  Shorten the format of research papers so
industrial developers may have enough time to write
them.  Increase the currency of our research papers
by decreasing their review times.

(Aside: it might appear that current journals
support "short" in their current call for
papers. However, speaking as authors who have tried
to make that kind of submission, we report that
short papers are rare at senior journals like IEEE
TSE.  Reviewers often reject the shorter paper,
demanding more details. The PIs have several such
papers that started out as as simple clear comments
on prior work but, after literally years of rewrites
and resubmissions, they appeared as very long
papers.)

## PROBLEM: Too Few Replicated Studies 

There are very few replications of prior SE results.
For example, in 2010, Robles published a
retrospective study of the 171 papers published in
the Mining Software Repositories (MSR) conference .
He found that over 95 of those papers were
unreproducible, since their associated data was no
longer on-line.  This lack of availability of old
MSR data was discussed, at length, at MSR 2013.
According to those participants, the single biggest
contributor to this issue was the lack of a
free-to-use long-term storage facility for big
files.  For example, free services like GitHub or
GoogleCode impose limits of just a few gigabytes on
the total repository size.

_SOLUTION:_ Create a large free-to-use repository
for SE research products. Later in this proposal, we
calculate, that this repository requires one
petabyte of storage.

## PROBLEM: Incomplete Descriptions

The traditional research paper is the final step in
a long process. Yet it only reports the last few
steps and not all the other products shown in types
that are needed to reproduce, improve, or refute the
original work.  Note that incomplete descriptions
also contributes to the Too Few Replicated Studies
problem.

_SOLUTION:_ Allow researchers to store all the types
products in a repository.  Make prominent and public
awards to researchers who contribute such products.

It should be added here that we recognized that our
industrial colleagues can make significant
contributions to academic research, even if their
local restrictions prevent them from contribution
proprietary products to the repository. Therefore
our editorial policies will allow papers that
comment on no repository products (in fact, we plan
to reach out to industrial contacts and encourage
such papers).

## PROBLEM: Slow writing times

Many of our industrial contacts complain that the
standard conference/journal paper (10 to 20+ pages
of 
motivation + related work + results + future work + conclusion) 
takes too long to write.

_SOLUTION:_ Divide a researcher's work into small
_research products_, each of which can be
peer-reviewed and published. For a list of our
proposed research products, see types.  Note that
since our _publishable unit_ can be shorter than the
standard format, we predict that more people will be
able to participate.

We hasten to add that our journal would publish
standard SE research papers (10+ pages of motivation
+ related work + results + discussion of future
work). But it would also accept papers as short as
one page that, for example:

+ Motivate some industrially-based challenge
problem; or
+ Reports a successful reproduction of prior work or
+ Shows drawbacks with a particular statistical
test.  That is, this infrastructure would enable
rapid peer review and publication of submissions
that are only as long as necessary to comment on any
one (or more) of the products listed in types.

## PROBLEM: Slow review times

It is an anachronism that, in the age of the
near-instantaneous world-wide connectivity, it still
it takes many months to years to get a conference or
journal paper accepted.

_SOLUTION:_ As discussed above, the journal would
support shorter papers, thus enabling shorter review
times (e.g. one month, or less, for each four pages
of submitted material).  This, in turn, would
decrease the "cycle-time" between (a) original
idea and (b) eventually dissemination would be
reduced.

Since publication cycles would be shorter,
industrial practitioners would have faster access to
results.  Also, researchers could use the journal
for on-going debates with peers to get earlier
feedback on their work.

## PROBLEM: New Modes of Communication are Under-Utilized

When academics meet at conferences, there is much
they can learn from their face-to-face
interactions. Unfortunately, many researchers cannot
attend conferences.  Given the time and cost
involved, it is too expensive for a research lead to
take their entire research lab to all the
conferences. Hence, often only the research lead
benefits from the personnel connections at
conferences.  This is particularly true for
academics from traditionally under-represented
groups with fewer economic resources.

In this age of widespread social media, it is
possible that useful teams can form between
academics, without needing to meet face to
face. Such an approach to research can reduce the
cost of collaboration and allow more human resources
to be applied to current research issues.

_SOLUTION:_ Publish research products using the
workflow and discussion tools developed in the agile
software community (e.g. 
[the GitHb repos](https://github.com/opensciences/opensciences.github.io) 
we use to host this web site).  In this way, researchers need
not travel to conferences in order to have extensive
interactions with other researchers from around the
world.  Instead, they could benefit from the same
style of rapid and broad scale interaction available
to open source developers.

One example of such a workflow and discussion tool is GitHub. Used by 3.4 million users,
GitHub is fast become the defacto standard for collaborators sharing the details of their software products.
Our current prototype for the journal, shown in con can be found on the web
at 
[http://openscience.us/ssj](http://openscience.us/ssj).
This web site
is served from the GitHub repo shown top right of con.
To update the website, we need only write a file in the Markdown syntax (see bottom right of con)
and commit it to the repository (but for papers with very complex layout, we would continue to allow authors to submit
PDF files built using Word or style files that we supply).
