On Policy Evolution
--------------------------

Open, virtual "town halls" will be held to discuss editorial policy.

The "volume" of the journal is released whenever the editorial policy changes.

Policies for Volume 1
---------------------

### Paper Evaluation

SSJ accepts a wide variety of papers, include those
in _traditional_ and _novel_ formats:

+ A _traditional format_ paper is (say) 3000
  words describing a (1) motivational
  statement followed by (2) some related work then
  (3) a description of the study instruments and (4)
  results from those instruments then (5) a
  discussion of external validity.
+ On the other hand, _novel formats_ can be much
  more varied.  The view of SSJ is that research
  papers contain many 
   [research products](researchproducts.html), any of
  which can be separately peer-reviewed and
  published. 

Hence, an SSJ article need not be a "complete"
piece of work containing all the background knowledge required
to understand that work. Rather, it an SSJ is article
can be the next statement in a long sequence
of research (and that statement need only offer very
short notes on the background work, provided those
notes come with references to the older work).

Note that since SSJ papers can be as short as a
single [research products](researchproducts.html),
these SSJ papers can be much shorter than other
journals. Hence, SSJ can offer faster review times
for these shorter papers.

### Review Process 

Articles will be submitted in a PDF format,
  according to our [house format]({{url}}/format).

Articles are reviewed on monthly cycles, starting
  on the first of each month. Deadlines are the
  first of each month.

If an article is accepted without changes, the
  article will be published immediately in that
  month's issue.

If an article is not accepted, the authors may
  choose to submit it the following month.

The Software Science Journal offers review times proportional to
  the length of the submission:
  
+ One month times each  _single length_.

where _single length_ is for:

+ Up to four pages of PDF files, in the [house format]({{url}}/format).
+ Up to 3400 words of Markdown files (where every figure and table
        counts for 250 words).

That is, short single length papers will be
reviewed in one month's time (that is, any article
submitted by the first of the month will be
returned with reviews and a decision by the end of
the month). Double, triple, and quadruple length papers
(e.g. up to eight or twelve or sixteen pages of PDF)
will take two, three, four months to review.

Articles are reviewed in a single-blind fashion.

The editorial board is divided in half, such that
  half of the editors handle submissions on odd
  months, and half on even months.

Published articles will be hosted on arxiv.org,
  and linked to through the journal's page.

Accepted articles will be published under a
  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license.

Preferences given to articles whose authors make
  their study artifacts openly available.

+ Additional preference will be given to authors who
	   make their study artifacts available
	   on [tera-Promise](http://openscience.us/content).

### Special Issues

Potential guest editors may submit proposals for
  special issues. The reviewing process remains the
  same, except that the guest editors do the work
  that the editorial board would normally do.

Proposals for special issues are reviewed by the
  editors in chief, and will be evaluated according
  to their relevance to the journal and their
  likelihood to attract high quality submissions.

The editors in chief will aggressively solicit
  *best papers* from top conferences to submit to
  special issues.

Workshops and conferences are simply treated as
  special issues. Here is an example of how a
  hypothetical paper that is presented at a
  conference that is published as a special issue
  would be cited:

    @article{citeulike:11236861,
        author = {Rodriguez, Bender},
        doi = {10.1007/s10844-006-9928-6},
        issn = {0925-9992},
        journal = {Proceedings of the Conference on
		           Advanced Bending Technologies in the
				   Software Science Journal},
        volume = {9},
        number = {3},
        pages = {7--24},
        title = {Bite Me},
        url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1419.0569},
        year = {2014}
    }
