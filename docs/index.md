Welcome to the documentation for the OpenScience job roles. This page is indended for people interested in 
becoming a curator or web developer for OpenScience, specifically the tera-PROMISE repository. I'll first be 
going over some background information about what OpenScience does and what the tera-PROMISE repository does, 
and then I'll go over what specific work that a Curator and a Web Developer does for the repository.

# Background
OpenScience, hosted on GitHub Pages, is a collection of three major projects: the tera-PROMISE repository, the
Software Science Journal (SSJ), and the "Latest Developments in Software Engineering" book. As of Spring 2015, only
the tera-PROMISE repository has been fully implemented; however, plans still exist for development of the journal
and the book. You can see the three projects in the homepage at [openscience.us](http://openscience.us).

The tera-PROMISE repository is, fundamentally speaking, a repository for data. More specifically, it stores
software engineering (SE) research data in the long term (more details in the next section about why it exists).
The SSJ is an academic journal that writes about the more useful data from the repository, and the book is a more
substantial academic text that condenses the best parts of the journal as they are generated over the journal's
maturation. You may have noticed the blurbs underneath the project icons on the homepage: "Pieces and bits from SE
research", "Judging which bits are useful", and "A textbook on the useful bits"; they describe the workflow of
"repository to journal to book" pretty well.

# The tera-PROMISE repository
What you're looking at right now is a page on the tera-PROMISE repository. There are no links to it because the 
public doesn't need to see it. The goal of the repository is to store software engineering research data for 
researchers to access at any time. It was started in 2004 by Dr. Tim Menzies of NCSU and Jelber Sayyad of the 
University of Ottawa, with the goal of being a long-term host for researchers to keep their data, because over 
time, data hosted on personal sites and university sites is phased out and lost to the sands of time. This is bad 
because software engineering is meant to be __reproducible__ and __replicable__. Reproducibility is the ability to 
reproduce an experiment; e.g. take somebody’s previous experiment and rerun it with either their data or on your 
own data. Replicability is achieved when the __same__ results are gathered from the __same__ experimental methods 
with the __same__ data. 

The fact that a lot of research data is being lost over time (or not hosted at all) breaks the academic research 
model. Tera-PROMISE is our solution to that problem, and that's where you the reader comes in.

Jobs
====
There are three main jobs associated with the tera-PROMISE repository. The SSJ and book aren't in active 
development at the time of this writing, so no work is needed in those departments (but somebody needs to update 
this documentation if these statements are outdated...).

Here are the jobs:

* **Curator:**
   * The curator does the actual uploading of the data to the site. This involves taking information about the data from GitHub issues, putting it on the GitHub site, and then uploading the actual data to an SVN repository. More information about this role can be found [here](/docs/curator.html).
* **Web developer/Systems programmer:**
   * The web developer/systems programmer (for lack of a better name) is responsible for the development of the GitHub website and it's functionality. More information about this role can be found [here](/docs/developer.html).
* **Data Finder:**
   * The Data Finder is responsible for looking through software engineering conferences and other internet resources to find research papers that may have data we can host. They also gather context notes on the promising papers for Curators to use when uploading to the site. This role is not an internal job; anybody can contribute, so there is a seperate contribution page found [here](/repo/contribute) that describes it thoroughly.
