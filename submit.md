On Policy Evolution
--------------------------

Open, virtual "town halls" will be held to discuss editorial policy.

The "volume" of the journal is released whenever the editorial policy changes.

Review Process
---------------------

Articles will be submitted in a PDF format,
  according to our [house style](format).

Articles are reviewed on monthly cycles, starting
  on the first of each month. Deadlines are the
  first of each month.

If an article is accepted without changes, the
  article will be published immediately in that
  month's issue.

If an article is not accepted, the authors may
  choose to submit it the following month.

The Software Science Journal offers review times proportional to
  the length of the submission:
  
    + One month times each  _single length_.

where _single length_ is for:

+ Up to four pages of PDF files, in the [house format](format).
+ Up to 3400 words of Markdown files (where every figure and table
        counts for 250 words).

That is, short single length papers will be
reviewed in one month's time (that is, any article
submitted by the first of the month will be
returned with reviews and a decision by the end of
the month). Double, triple, and quadruple length papers
(e.g. up to eight or twelve or sixteen pages of PDF)
will take two, three, four months to review.

Articles are reviewed in a single-blind fashion.

The editorial board is divided in half, such that
  half of the editors handle submissions on odd
  months, and half on even months.

Published articles will be hosted on arxive.org,
  and linked to through the journal's page.

Accepted articles will be published under a
  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license.

Preferences given to articles whose authors make
  their study artifacts openly available.

+ Additional preference will be given to authors who
	   make their study artifacts available
	   on [tera-Promise](http://openscience.us/content).

Special Issues
--------------------

Potential guest editors may submit proposals for
  special issues. The reviewing process remains the
  same, except that the guest editors do the work
  that the editorial board would normally do.

Proposals for special issues are reviewed by the
  editors in chief, and will be evaluated according
  to their relevance to the journal and their
  likelihood to attract high quality submissions.

The editors in chief will aggressively solicit
  *best papers* from top conferences to submit to
  special issues.

Workshops and conferences are simply treated as
  special issues. Here is an example of how a
  hypothetical paper that is presented at a
  conference that is published as a special issue
  would be cited:

    @article{citeulike:11236861,
        author = {Rodriguez, Bender},
        doi = {10.1007/s10844-006-9928-6},
        issn = {0925-9992},
        journal = {Proceedings of the Conference on Advanced Bending Technologies in the Journal of Software Science},
        volume = {9},
        number = {3},
        pages = {7--24},
        title = {Bite Me},
        url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1419.0569},
        year = {2014}
    }
